##### Build Script README #####
#
##### INSTRUCTIONS:
# The build script must be run in the scripts/ folder.
# The build script asks for sudo privileges so that the strip-image script runs properly.
#
##### EXPLANATION:
#
# The script removes docker leftovers, such as containers, images and networks.
# The script then creates the docker network "iss2023/bravo-4_n" with the subnet "198.51.100.0/24"
# The script then builds the full webserver image, 
# then cd's into the webserver folder and strips the full image
#
# The script then builds the full database image, 
# then cd's into the dbserver folder and strips the full image
#
# The full webserver and full database images are deleted
