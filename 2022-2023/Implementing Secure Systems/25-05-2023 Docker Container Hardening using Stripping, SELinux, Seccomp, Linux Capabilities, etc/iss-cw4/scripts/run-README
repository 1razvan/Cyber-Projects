##### Run Script README #####
#
##### INSTRUCTIONS:
# All run script must be run in the scripts/ folder.
# The one-off-run-config script asks for sudo privileges so that the SELinux policies can be applied.
#
##### EXPLANATION:
# The one-off-run-config script makes the dbserver and webserver .te SELinux policies into .pp files.
# The one-off-run-config script installs the dbserver and webserver SELinux policies.
# The one-off-run-config script confirms the dbserver and webserver SELinux policies are installed.
#
# The one-off-run-config script removes leftover docker volumes from a previous run.
# The one-off-run-config creates a new docker volume called "bravo-4-db-volume".
#
# The one-off-run-config script runs the database server stripped image once 
# with the container USER as "root" to initialise the iss2023 database and 
# to write the /var/lib/mysql/ folder into the docker volume "bravo-4-db-volume".
#
# This container is then killed and removed.
#
# The one-off-run-config script then runs the database server stripped image once again,
# the container runs as user "mysql"
# this fixes the /var/lib/mysql/ 's folder and its files' permissions
# this needs to be run here once, without seccomp
# as it uses several syscalls that are not needed later for the repeated run script, i.e. chmod().
#
# The repeated-run script launches the dbserver and webserver with all security options
# (SELinux, Seccomp and Capabilities)
#
# SELinux blocks some calls for usage on the udp_socket,
# however they are not needed for the server's functionality.
